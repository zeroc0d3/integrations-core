The entrypoint for E2E management is the command group ddev env . Discovery \u00b6 Use the ls command to see what environments are available, for example: $ ddev env ls envoy envoy: py27 py38 You'll notice that only environments that actually run tests are available. Running simply ddev env ls with no arguments will display the active environments. Creation \u00b6 To start an environment run ddev env start <INTEGRATION> <ENVIRONMENT> , for example: $ ddev env start envoy py38 Setting up environment `py38`... success! Updating `datadog/agent-dev:master`... success! Detecting the major version... Agent 7 detected Writing configuration for `py38`... success! Starting the Agent... success! Config file (copied to your clipboard): C:\\Users\\ofek\\AppData\\Local\\dd-checks-dev\\envs\\envoy\\py38\\config\\envoy.yaml To run this check, do: ddev env check envoy py38 To stop this check, do: ddev env stop envoy py38 This sets up the selected environment and an instance of the Agent running in a Docker container. The default configuration is defined by each environment's test suite and is saved to a file, which is then mounted to the Agent container so you may freely modify it. Let's see what we have running: $ docker ps --format \"table {{.Image}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Ports}}\\t{{.Names}}\" IMAGE STATUS PORTS NAMES datadog/agent-dev:master-py3 Up 4 seconds (health: starting) dd_envoy_py38 default_service2 Up 5 seconds 80/tcp, 10000/tcp default_service2_1 envoyproxy/envoy:latest Up 5 seconds 0.0.0.0:8001->8001/tcp, 10000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8000->80/tcp default_front-envoy_1 default_xds Up 5 seconds 8080/tcp default_xds_1 default_service1 Up 5 seconds 80/tcp, 10000/tcp default_service1_1 Agent version \u00b6 You can select a particular build of the Agent to use with the --agent / -a option. Any Docker image is valid e.g. datadog/agent:7.17.0 . A custom nightly build will be used by default, which is re-built on every commit to the Datadog Agent repository . Integration version \u00b6 By default the version of the integration used will be the one shipped with the chosen Agent version, as if you had passed in the --prod flag. If you wish to modify an integration and test changes in real time, use the --dev flag. Doing so will mount and install the integration in the Agent container. All modifications to the integration's directory will be propagated to the Agent, whether it be a code change or switching to a different Git branch. If you modify the base package then you will need to mount that with the --base flag, which implicitly activates --dev . Testing \u00b6 To run tests against the live Agent, use the ddev env test command. It is similar to the test command except it is capable of running tests marked as E2E , and only runs such tests. Automation \u00b6 You can use the --new-env / -ne flag to automate environment management. For example running: ddev env test apache:py38 vault:py38 -ne will start the py38 environment for Apache, run E2E tests, tear down the environment, and then do the same for Vault. Tip Since running tests implies code changes are being introduced, --new-env enables --dev by default. Execution \u00b6 Similar to the Agent's check command, you can perform manual check runs using ddev env check <INTEGRATION> <ENVIRONMENT> , for example: $ ddev env check envoy py38 --log-level debug ... ========= Collector ========= Running Checks ============== envoy (1.12.0) -------------- Instance ID: envoy:c705bd922a3c275c [OK] Configuration Source: file:/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/envoy.d/envoy.yaml Total Runs: 1 Metric Samples: Last Run: 546, Total: 546 Events: Last Run: 0, Total: 0 Service Checks: Last Run: 1, Total: 1 Average Execution Time : 25ms Last Execution Date : 2020-02-17 00:58:05.000000 UTC Last Successful Execution Date : 2020-02-17 00:58:05.000000 UTC Debugging \u00b6 You may start an interactive debugging session using the --breakpoint / -b option. The option accepts an integer representing the line number at which to break. For convenience, 0 and -1 are shortcuts to the first and last line of the integration's check method, respectively. $ ddev env check envoy py38 -b 0 > /opt/datadog-agent/embedded/lib/python3.8/site-packages/datadog_checks/envoy/envoy.py(34)check() -> custom_tags = instance.get('tags', []) (Pdb) list 29 self.blacklisted_metrics = set() 30 31 self.caching_metrics = None 32 33 def check(self, instance): 34 B-> custom_tags = instance.get('tags', []) 35 36 try: 37 stats_url = instance['stats_url'] 38 except KeyError: 39 msg = 'Envoy configuration setting `stats_url` is required' (Pdb) print(instance) {'stats_url': 'http://localhost:8001/stats'} Caveat The line number must be within the integration's check method. Refreshing state \u00b6 Testing and manual check runs always reflect the current state of code and configuration however, if you want to see the result of changes in-app , you will need to refresh the environment by running ddev env reload <INTEGRATION> <ENVIRONMENT> . Removal \u00b6 To stop an environment run ddev env stop <INTEGRATION> <ENVIRONMENT> . Any environments that haven't been explicitly stopped will show as active in the output of ddev env ls , even persisting through system restarts. If you are confident that environments are no longer active, you can run ddev env prune to remove all accumulated environment state.","title":"E2E"},{"location":"e2e/#e2e","text":"Any integration that makes use of our pytest plugin in its test suite supports end-to-end testing on a live Datadog Agent .

If you don't have a particular version installed (for example Python 2.7), such environments will be skipped. The second part of a test environment's name corresponds to the version of the product. For example, the 11 in py38-11 implies tests will run against version 11.x of PostgreSQL. If there is no version suffix, it means that either: the version is pinned, usually set to pull the latest release, or there is no concept of a product, such as the disk check Usage \u00b6 Explicit \u00b6 Passing just the integration name will run every test environment e.g. executing ddev test envoy will run the environments py27 , py38 , and style . You may select a subset of environments to run by appending a : followed by a comma-separated list of environments. For example, executing: ddev test postgres:py38-11,style envoy:py38 will run, in order, the environments py38-11 and style for the PostgreSQL check and the environment py38 for the Envoy check. Detection \u00b6 If no integrations are specified then only integrations that were changed will be tested, based on a diff between the latest commit to the current and master branches. The criteria for an integration to be considered changed is based on the file extension of paths in the diff. So for example if only Markdown files were modified then nothing will be tested. The integrations will be tested in lexicographical order. Coverage \u00b6 To measure code coverage, use the --cov / -c flag.

Be sure you are familiar with SNMP concepts , and you have read through the official SNMP integration docs . Overview \u00b6 While most integrations are either Python, JMX, or implemented in the Agent in Go, the SNMP integration is a bit more complex. Here's an overview of what this integration involves: A Python check , responsible for: Collecting metrics from a specific device IP. Metrics typically come from profiles , but they can also be specified explicitly . Auto-discovering devices over a network. (Pending deprecation in favor of Agent auto-discovery.) An Agent service listener , responsible for auto-discovering devices over a network and forwarding discovered instances to the existing Agent check scheduling pipeline. Also known as \"Agent SNMP auto-discovery\". The diagram below shows how these components interact for a typical VM-based setup (single Agent on a host). For Datadog Cluster Agent (DCA) deployments, see Cluster Agent Integration . Python Check \u00b6 Dependencies \u00b6 The Python check uses PySNMP to make SNMP queries and manipulate SNMP data (OIDs, variables, and MIBs). Device Monitoring \u00b6 The primary functionality of the Python check is to collect metrics from a given device given its IP address. As all Python checks, it supports multi-instances configuration, where each instance represents a device: instances : - ip_address : \"192.168.0.12\" # <Options...> Python Auto-Discovery \u00b6 Approach \u00b6 The Python check includes a multithreaded implementation of device auto-discovery. It runs on instances that use network_address instead of ip_address : instances : - network_address : \"192.168.0.0/28\" # <Options...> The main tasks performed by device auto-discovery are: Find new devices : For each IP in the network_address CIDR range, the check queries the device sysObjectID . If the query succeeds and the sysObjectID matches one of the registered profiles, the device is added as a discovered instance. This logic is run at regular intervals in a separate thread. Cache devices : To improve performance, discovered instances are cached on disk based on a hash of the instance. Since options from the network_address instance are copied into discovered instances, the cache is invalidated if the network_address changes. Check devices : On each check run, the check runs a check on all discovered instances. This is done in parallel using a threadpool. The check waits for all sub-checks to finish. Handle failures : Discovered instances that fail after a configured number of times are dropped. They may be rediscovered later. Submit discovery-related metrics : the check submits the total number of discovered devices for a given network_address instance. Caveats \u00b6 The approach described above is not ideal for several reasons: The check code is harder to understand since the two distinct paths (\"single device\" vs \"entire network\") live in a single integration. Each network instance manages several long-running threads that span well beyond the lifespan of a single check run. Each network check pseudo-schedules other instances, which is normally the responsibility of the Agent. For this reason, auto-discovery was eventually implemented in the Agent as a proper service listener (see below), and users should be discouraged from using Python auto-discovery. When the deprecation period expires, we will be able to remove auto-discovery logic from the Python check, making it exclusively focused on checking single devices. Agent Auto-Discovery \u00b6 Dependencies \u00b6 Agent auto-discovery uses GoSNMP to get the sysObjectID of devices in the network. Standalone Agent \u00b6 Agent auto-discovery implements the same logic than the Python auto-discovery, but as a service listener in the Agent Go package. This approach leverages the existing Agent scheduling logic, and makes it possible to scale device auto-discovery using the Datadog Cluster Agent (see Cluster Agent Integration ). Pending official documentation, here is an example configuration: # datadog.yaml listeners : - name : snmp snmp_listener : configs : - network : 10.0.0.0/28 version : 2 community : public - network : 10.0.1.0/30 version : 3 user : my-snmp-user authentication_protocol : SHA authentication_key : \"*****\" privacy_protocol : AES privacy_key : \"*****\" ignored_ip_addresses : - 10.0.1.0 - 10.0.1.1 Cluster Agent Support \u00b6 For Kubernetes environments, the Cluster Agent can be configured to use the SNMP Agent auto-discovery (via snmp listener) logic as a source of Cluster checks . The Datadog Cluster Agent (DCA) uses the snmp_listener config (Agent auto-discovery) to listen for IP ranges, then schedules snmp check instances to be run by one or more normal Datadog Agents. Agent auto-discovery combined with Cluster Agent is very scalable, it can be used to monitor a large number of snmp devices.

From physical machines running VMware ESXi that are called ESXi Hosts, users can spin up or migrate Virtual Machines from one host to another. vSphere is an integrated solution and provides an easy managing interface over concepts like data storage, or computing resource. Terminology \u00b6 This section details some of vSphere specific elements. This section does not intend to be an extensive list, but rather a place for those unfamiliar with the product to have the basics required to understand how the Datadog integration works. vSphere - The complete suite of tools and technologies detailed in this article. vCenter server - The main machine which controls ESXi hosts and provides both a web UI and an API to control the vSphere environment. vCSA (vCenter Server Appliance) - A specific kind of vCenter where the software runs in a dedicated Linux machine (more recent). By opposition, the legacy vCenter is typically installed on an existing Windows machine. ESXi host - The physical machine controlled by vCenter where the ESXi (bare-metal) virtualizer is installed. The host boots a minimal OS that can run Virtual Machines. VM - What anyone using vSphere really needs in the end, instances that can run applications and code. Note: Datadog monitors both ESXi hosts and VMs and it calls them both \"host\" (they are in the host map). Attributes/tags - It is possible to add attributes and tags to any vSphere resource, note that those two are now very similar with \"attributes\" being the deprecated thing to use. Datacenter - A set of resources grouped together. A single vCenter server can handle multiple datacenters. Datastore - A virtual vSphere concept to represent data storing capabilities. It can be an NFS server that ESXi hosts have read/write access to, it can be a mounted disk on the host and more. Datastores are often shared between multiple hosts. This allows Virtual Machines to be migrated from one host to another. Cluster - A logical grouping of computational resources, you can add multiple ESXi hosts in your cluster and then you can create VM in the cluster (and not on a specific host, vSphere will take care of placing your VM in one of the ESXi hosts and migrating it when needed). Photon OS - An open-source minimal Linux distribution and used by both ESXi and vCSA as a base. The integration \u00b6 Setup \u00b6 The Datadog vSphere integration runs from a single agent and pulls all the information from a single vCenter endpoint. Because the agent cannot run directly on Photon OS, it is usually required that the agent runs within a dedicated VM inside the vSphere infrastructure. Once the agent is running, the minimal configuration (as of version 5.x) is as follows: init_config : instances : - host : username : password : use_legacy_check_version : false empty_default_hostname : true host is the endpoint used to access the vSphere Client from a web browser. The host is either a FQDN or an IP, not an http url. username and password are the credentials to log in to vCenter. use_legacy_check_version is a backward compatibility flag. It should always be set to false and this flag will be removed in a future version of the integration. Setting it to true tells the agent to use an older and deprecated version of the vSphere integration. empty_default_hostname is a field used by the agent directly (and not the integration). By default, the agent does not allow submitting metrics without attaching an explicit host tag unless this flag is set to true. The vSphere integration uses that behavior for some metrics and service checks. For example, the vsphere.vm.count metric which gives a count of the VMs in the infra is not submitted with a host tag. This is particularly important if the agent runs inside a vSphere VM. If the vsphere.vm.count was submitted with a host tag, the Datadog backend would attach all the other host tags to the metric, for example vsphere_type:vm or vsphere_host:<NAME_OF_THE_ESX_HOST> which makes the metric almost impossible to use. Concepts \u00b6 Collection level \u00b6 vSphere metrics are documented in their documentation page an each metric has a defined \"collection level\". That level determines the amount of data gathered by the integration and especially which metrics are available. More details here . By default, only the level 1 metrics are collected but this can be increased in the integration configuration file. Realtime vs historical \u00b6 Each ESXi host collects and stores data for each metric on himself and every VM it hosts every 20 seconds. Those data points are stored for up to one hour and are called realtime. Note: Each metric concerns always either a VM or an ESXi hosts. Metrics that concern datastore for example are not collected in the ESXi hosts. Additionally, the vCenter server collects data from all the ESXi hosts and stores the datapoint with some aggregation rollup into its own database. Those data points are called \"historical\". Finally, the vCenter server also collects metrics for other kinds of resources (like Datastore, ClusterComputeResource, Datacenter...) Those data points are necessarily \"historical\". The reason for such an important distinction is that historical metrics are much MUCH slower to collect than realtime metrics. The vSphere integration will always collect the \"realtime\" data for metrics that concern ESXi hosts and VMs. But the integration also collects metrics for Datastores, ClusterComputeResources, Datacenters, and maybe others in the future. That's why, in the context of the Datadog vSphere integration, we usually simplify by considering that: VMs and ESXi hosts are \"realtime resources\". Metrics for such resources are quick and easy to get by querying vCenter that will in turn query all the ESXi hosts. Datastores, ClusterComputeResources, and Datacenters are \"historical resources\" and are much slower to collect. To collect all metrics (realtime and historical), it is advised to use two \"check instances\". One with collection_type: realtime and one with collection_type: historical . This way all metrics will be collected but because both check instances are on different schedules, the slowness of collecting historical metrics won't affect the rate at which realtime metrics are collected. vSphere tags and attributes \u00b6 Similarly to how Datadog allows you to add tags to your different hosts (thins like the os or the instance-type of your machines), vSphere has \"tags\" and \"attributes\". A lot of details can be found here: https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-E8E854DD-AA97-4E0C-8419-CE84F93C4058.html#:~:text=Tags%20and%20attributes%20allow%20you,that%20tag%20to%20a%20category. But the overall idea is that both tags and attributes are additional information that you can attach to your vSphere resources and that \"tags\" are newer and more featureful than \"attributes\". Filtering \u00b6 A very flexible filtering system has been implemented with the vSphere integration. This allows fine-tuned configuration so that: You only pay for the host and VMs you really want to monitor. You reduce the load on your vCenter server by running just the queries that you need. You improve the check runtime which otherwise increases linearly with the size of their infrastructure and that was seen to take up to 10min in some large environments. We provide two types of filtering, one based on metrics, the other based on resources. The metric filter is fairly simple, for each resource type, you can provide some regexes. If a metric match any of the filter, it will be fetched and submitted. The configuration looks like this: metric_filters : vm : - cpu\\..* - mem\\..* host : - WHATEVER # Excludes everything datacenter : - .* The resource filter on the other hand, allows to exclude some vSphere resources (VM, ESXi host, etc.), based on an \"attribute\" of that resource. The possible attributes as of today are: - name , literally the name of the resource (as defined in vCenter) - inventory_path , a path-like string that represents the location of the resource in the inventory tree as each resource only ever has a single parent and recursively up to the root. For example: /my.datacenter.local/vm/staging/myservice/vm_name - tag , see the tags and attributes section. Used to filter resources based on the attached tags. - attribute , see the tags and attributes section. Used to filter resources based on the attached attributes. - hostname (only for VMs), the name of the ESXi host where the VM is running. - guest_hostname (only for VMs), the name of the OS as reported from within the machine. VMware tools have to be installed on the VM otherwise, vCenter is not able to fetch this information. A possible filtering configuration would look like this: resource_filters : - resource : vm property : name patterns : - <VM_REGEX_1> - <VM_REGEX_2> - resource : vm property : hostname patterns : - <HOSTNAME_REGEX> - resource : vm property : tag type : blacklist patterns : - '^env:staging$' - resource : vm property : tag type : whitelist # type defaults to whitelist patterns : - '^env:.*$' - resource : vm property : guest_hostname patterns : - <GUEST_HOSTNAME_REGEX> - resource : host property : inventory_path patterns : - <INVENTORY_PATH_REGEX> Instance tag \u00b6 In vSphere each metric is defined by three \"dimensions\". The resource on which the metric applies (for example the VM called \"abc1\") The name of the metric (for example cpu.usage). An additional available dimension that varies between metrics. (for example the cpu core id) This is similar to how Datadog represent metrics, except that the context cardinality is limited to two \"keys\", the name of the resource (usually the \"host\" tag), and there is space for one additional tag key. This available tag key is defined as the \"instance\" property, or \"instance tag\" in vSphere, and this dimension is not collected by default by the Datadog integration as it can have too big performance implications in large systems when compared to their added value from a monitoring perspective. Also when fetching metrics with the instance tag, vSphere only provides the value of the instance tag, it doesn't expose a human-readable \"key\" for that tag. In the cpu.usage metric with the core_id as the instance tag, the integration has to \"know\" that the meaning of the instance tag and that's why we rely on a hardcoded list in the integration. Because this instance tag can provide additional visibility, it is possible to enable it for some metrics from the configuration. For example, if we're really interested in getting the usage of the cpu per core, the setup can look like this: collect_per_instance_filters : vm : - cpu\\.usage\\..*","title":"vSphere"},{"location":"architecture/vsphere/#vsphere","text":"","title":"vSphere"},{"location":"architecture/vsphere/#high-level-information","text":"","title":"High-Level information"},{"location":"architecture/vsphere/#product-overview","text":"vSphere is a VMware product dedicated to managing a (usually) on-premise infrastructure.

This section does not intend to be an extensive list, but rather a place for those unfamiliar with the product to have the basics required to understand how the Datadog integration works. vSphere - The complete suite of tools and technologies detailed in this article. vCenter server - The main machine which controls ESXi hosts and provides both a web UI and an API to control the vSphere environment. vCSA (vCenter Server Appliance) - A specific kind of vCenter where the software runs in a dedicated Linux machine (more recent). By opposition, the legacy vCenter is typically installed on an existing Windows machine. ESXi host - The physical machine controlled by vCenter where the ESXi (bare-metal) virtualizer is installed. The host boots a minimal OS that can run Virtual Machines. VM - What anyone using vSphere really needs in the end, instances that can run applications and code. Note: Datadog monitors both ESXi hosts and VMs and it calls them both \"host\" (they are in the host map). Attributes/tags - It is possible to add attributes and tags to any vSphere resource, note that those two are now very similar with \"attributes\" being the deprecated thing to use. Datacenter - A set of resources grouped together. A single vCenter server can handle multiple datacenters. Datastore - A virtual vSphere concept to represent data storing capabilities. It can be an NFS server that ESXi hosts have read/write access to, it can be a mounted disk on the host and more. Datastores are often shared between multiple hosts. This allows Virtual Machines to be migrated from one host to another. Cluster - A logical grouping of computational resources, you can add multiple ESXi hosts in your cluster and then you can create VM in the cluster (and not on a specific host, vSphere will take care of placing your VM in one of the ESXi hosts and migrating it when needed).

Because the agent cannot run directly on Photon OS, it is usually required that the agent runs within a dedicated VM inside the vSphere infrastructure. Once the agent is running, the minimal configuration (as of version 5.x) is as follows: init_config : instances : - host : username : password : use_legacy_check_version : false empty_default_hostname : true host is the endpoint used to access the vSphere Client from a web browser. The host is either a FQDN or an IP, not an http url. username and password are the credentials to log in to vCenter. use_legacy_check_version is a backward compatibility flag. It should always be set to false and this flag will be removed in a future version of the integration. Setting it to true tells the agent to use an older and deprecated version of the vSphere integration. empty_default_hostname is a field used by the agent directly (and not the integration). By default, the agent does not allow submitting metrics without attaching an explicit host tag unless this flag is set to true. The vSphere integration uses that behavior for some metrics and service checks. For example, the vsphere.vm.count metric which gives a count of the VMs in the infra is not submitted with a host tag. This is particularly important if the agent runs inside a vSphere VM. If the vsphere.vm.count was submitted with a host tag, the Datadog backend would attach all the other host tags to the metric, for example vsphere_type:vm or vsphere_host:<NAME_OF_THE_ESX_HOST> which makes the metric almost impossible to use.","title":"Setup"},{"location":"architecture/vsphere/#concepts","text":"","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"architecture/vsphere/#collection-level","text":"vSphere metrics are documented in their documentation page an each metric has a defined \"collection level\".

Checks \u00b6 AgentCheck contains functions that you use to execute Checks and submit data to Datadog. Metrics \u00b6 This list enumerates what is collected from your system by each integration. For more information on metrics, see the Metric Types documentation. You can find the metrics for each integration in that integration's metadata.csv file. You can also set up custom metrics , so if the integration doesn\u2019t offer a metric out of the box, you can usually add it. Gauge \u00b6 The gauge metric submission type represents a snapshot of events in one time interval. This representative snapshot value is the last value submitted to the Agent during a time interval. A gauge can be used to take a measure of something reporting continuously\u2014like the available disk space or memory used. For more information, see the API documentation Count \u00b6 The count metric submission type represents the total number of event occurrences in one time interval. A count can be used to track the total number of connections made to a database or the total number of requests to an endpoint. This number of events can increase or decrease over time\u2014it is not monotonically increasing. For more information, see the API documentation . Monotonic Count \u00b6 Similar to Count, Monotonic Count represents the total number of event occurrences in one time interval. However, this value can ONLY increment. For more information, see the API documentation . Rate \u00b6 The rate metric submission type represents the total number of event occurrences per second in one time interval. A rate can be used to track how often something is happening\u2014like the frequency of connections made to a database or the flow of requests made to an endpoint. For more information, see the API documentation . Histogram \u00b6 The histogram metric submission type represents the statistical distribution of a set of values calculated Agent-side in one time interval. Datadog\u2019s histogram metric type is an extension of the StatsD timing metric type: the Agent aggregates the values that are sent in a defined time interval and produces different metrics which represent the set of values. For more information, see the API documentation . Historate \u00b6 Similar to the histogram metric, the historate represents statistical distribution over one time interval, although this is based on rate metrics. For more information, see the API documentation . Service Checks \u00b6 Service checks are a type of monitor used to track the uptime status of the service. For more information, see the Service checks guide. For more information, see the API documentation . Events \u00b6 Events are informational messages about your system that are consumed by the events stream so that you can build monitors on them. For more information, see the API documentation . Namespacing \u00b6 Within every integration, you can specify the value of __NAMESPACE__ : from datadog_checks.base import AgentCheck class AwesomeCheck ( AgentCheck ): __NAMESPACE__ = 'awesome' ... This is an optional addition, but it makes submissions easier since it prefixes every metric with the __NAMESPACE__ automatically. In this case it would append awesome. to each metric submitted to Datadog. If you wish to ignore the namespace for any reason, you can append an optional Boolean raw=True to each submission: self . gauge ( 'test' , 1.23 , tags = [ 'foo:bar' ], raw = True ) ... You submitted a gauge metric named test with a value of 1.23 tagged by foo:bar ignoring the namespace. Check Initializations \u00b6 In the AgentCheck class, there is a useful property called check_initializations , which you can use to execute functions that are called once before the first check run. You can fill up check_initializations with instructions in the __init__ function of an integration. For example, you could use it to parse configuration information before running a check. Listed below is an example with Airflow: class AirflowCheck ( AgentCheck ): def __init__ ( self , name , init_config , instances ): super ( AirflowCheck , self ) . __init__ ( name , init_config , instances ) self . _url = self . instance . get ( 'url' , '' ) self . _tags = self . instance . get ( 'tags' , []) # The Agent only makes one attempt to instantiate each AgentCheck so any errors occurring # in `__init__` are logged just once, making it difficult to spot. Therefore, # potential configuration errors are emitted as part of the check run phase. # The configuration is only parsed once if it succeed, otherwise it's retried. self . check_initializations . append ( self . _parse_config ) ...","title":"Basics"},{"location":"base/basics/#basics","text":"The AgentCheck base class contains the logic that all Checks inherit.

Example: ```yaml columns: - name: time_since_x type: time_elapsed format: native # default value and can be omitted - name: time_since_y type: time_elapsed format: unix_time - name: time_since_z type: time_elapsed format: \"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S\" ``` !!! note The code `%z` (lower case) is not supported on Windows. \"\"\" time_format = modifiers . pop ( 'format' , 'native' ) if not isinstance ( time_format , str ): raise ValueError ( 'the `format` parameter must be a string' ) gauge = transformers [ 'gauge' ]( transformers , column_name , ** modifiers ) if time_format == 'native' : def time_elapsed ( _ , value , ** kwargs ): # type: (List, str, Dict[str, Any]) -> None value = ensure_aware_datetime ( value ) gauge ( _ , ( datetime . now ( value . tzinfo ) - value ) . total_seconds (), ** kwargs ) elif time_format == 'unix_time' : def time_elapsed ( _ , value , ** kwargs ): gauge ( _ , time . time () - value , ** kwargs ) else : def time_elapsed ( _ , value , ** kwargs ): # type: (List, str, Dict[str, Any]) -> None value = ensure_aware_datetime ( datetime . strptime ( value , time_format )) gauge ( _ , ( datetime . now ( value . tzinfo ) - value ) . total_seconds (), ** kwargs ) return time_elapsed datadog_checks.base.utils.db.transform.ExtraTransformers \u00b6 Every column transformer (except tag ) is supported at this level, the only difference being one must set a source to retrieve the desired value. So for example here: columns : - name : foo.bar type : rate extras : - name : foo.current type : gauge source : foo.bar the metric foo.current will be sent as a gauge will the value of foo.bar . expression ( transformers , name , ** modifiers ) \u00b6 This allows the evaluation of a limited subset of Python syntax and built-in functions. columns : - name : disk.total type : gauge - name : disk.used type : gauge extras : - name : disk.free expression : disk.total - disk.used submit_type : gauge For brevity, if the expression attribute exists and type does not then it is assumed the type is expression . The submit_type can be any transformer and any extra options are passed down to it. The result of every expression is stored, so in lieu of a submit_type the above example could also be written as: columns : - name : disk.total type : gauge - name : disk.used type : gauge extras : - name : free expression : disk.total - disk.used - name : disk.free type : gauge source : free The order matters though, so for example the following will fail: columns : - name : disk.total type : gauge - name : disk.used type : gauge extras : - name : disk.free type : gauge source : free - name : free expression : disk.total - disk.used since the source free does not yet exist.

We currently support Prometheus gauge , counter , histogram , and summary metric types. Gauge \u00b6 A gauge metric represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up or down. Prometheus gauge metrics are submitted as Datadog gauge metrics. Counter \u00b6 A Prometheus counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter whose value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart. Config Option Value Datadog Metric Submitted send_monotonic_counter true (default) monotonic_count false gauge Histogram \u00b6 A Prometheus histogram samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets along with a sum of all observed values. Histogram metrics ending in: _sum represent the total sum of all observed values. Generally sums are like counters but it's also possible for a negative observation which would not behave like a typical always increasing counter. _count represent the total number of events that have been observed. _bucket represent the cumulative counters for the observation buckets. Note that buckets are only submitted if send_histogram_buckets is enabled. Subtype Config Option Value Datadog Metric Submitted send_distribution_buckets true The entire histogram can be submitted as a single distribution metric . If the option is enabled, none of the subtype metrics will be submitted. _sum send_distribution_sums_as_monotonic false (default) gauge true monotonic_count _count send_distribution_counts_as_monotonic false (default) gauge true monotonic_count _bucket non_cumulative_buckets false (default) gauge true monotonic_count under .count metric name if send_distribution_counts_as_monotonic is enabled. Otherwise, gauge . Summary \u00b6 Prometheus summary metrics are similar to histograms but allow configurable quantiles. Summary metrics ending in: _sum represent the total sum of all observed values. Generally sums are like counters but it's also possible for a negative observation which would not behave like a typical always increasing counter. _count represent the total number of events that have been observed. metrics with labels like {quantile=\"<\u03c6>\"} represent the streaming quantiles of observed events.

False ddev meta snmp generate-profile-from-mibs \u00b6 Generate an SNMP profile from MIBs. Accepts a directory path containing mib files to be used as source to generate the profile, along with a filter if a device or family of devices support only a subset of oids from a mib. filters is the path to a yaml file containing a collection of MIBs, with their list of MIB node names to be included. For example: RFC1213-MIB : - system - interfaces - ip CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB : [] SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB : - snmpEngine Note that each MIB:node_name correspond to exactly one and only one OID. However, some MIBs report legacy nodes that are overwritten. To resolve, edit the MIB by removing legacy values manually before loading them with this profile generator. If a MIB is fully supported, it can be omitted from the filter as MIBs not found in a filter will be fully loaded. If a MIB is not fully supported, it can be listed with an empty node list, as CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB in the example. -a, --aliases is an option to provide the path to a YAML file containing a list of aliases to be used as metric tags for tables, in the following format: aliases : - from : MIB : ENTITY-MIB name : entPhysicalIndex to : MIB : ENTITY-MIB name : entPhysicalName MIBs tables most of the time define a column OID within the table, or from a different table and even different MIB, which value can be used to index entries. This is the INDEX field in row nodes. As an example, entPhysicalContainsTable in ENTITY-MIB entPhysicalContainsEntry OBJECT-TYPE SYNTAX EntPhysicalContainsEntry MAX-ACCESS not-accessible STATUS current DESCRIPTION \"A single container/'containee' relationship.\" INDEX { entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalChildIndex } ::= { entPhysicalContainsTable 1 } or its json dump, where INDEX is replaced by indices \"entPhysicalContainsEntry\" : { \"name\" : \"entPhysicalContainsEntry\" , \"oid\" : \"1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1\" , \"nodetype\" : \"row\" , \"class\" : \"objecttype\" , \"maxaccess\" : \"not-accessible\" , \"indices\" : [ { \"module\" : \"ENTITY-MIB\" , \"object\" : \"entPhysicalIndex\" , \"implied\" : 0 }, { \"module\" : \"ENTITY-MIB\" , \"object\" : \"entPhysicalChildIndex\" , \"implied\" : 0 } ], \"status\" : \"current\" , \"description\" : \"A single container/'containee' relationship.\" }, Sometimes indexes are columns from another table, and we might want to use another column as it could have more human readable information - we might prefer to see the interface name vs its numerical table index.

For example: RFC1213-MIB : - system - interfaces - ip CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB : [] SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB : - snmpEngine Note that each MIB:node_name correspond to exactly one and only one OID. However, some MIBs report legacy nodes that are overwritten. To resolve, edit the MIB by removing legacy values manually before loading them with this profile generator. If a MIB is fully supported, it can be omitted from the filter as MIBs not found in a filter will be fully loaded. If a MIB is not fully supported, it can be listed with an empty node list, as CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB in the example. -a, --aliases is an option to provide the path to a YAML file containing a list of aliases to be used as metric tags for tables, in the following format: aliases : - from : MIB : ENTITY-MIB name : entPhysicalIndex to : MIB : ENTITY-MIB name : entPhysicalName MIBs tables most of the time define a column OID within the table, or from a different table and even different MIB, which value can be used to index entries. This is the INDEX field in row nodes. As an example, entPhysicalContainsTable in ENTITY-MIB entPhysicalContainsEntry OBJECT-TYPE SYNTAX EntPhysicalContainsEntry MAX-ACCESS not-accessible STATUS current DESCRIPTION \"A single container/'containee' relationship.\" INDEX { entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalChildIndex } ::= { entPhysicalContainsTable 1 } or its json dump, where INDEX is replaced by indices \"entPhysicalContainsEntry\" : { \"name\" : \"entPhysicalContainsEntry\" , \"oid\" : \"1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1\" , \"nodetype\" : \"row\" , \"class\" : \"objecttype\" , \"maxaccess\" : \"not-accessible\" , \"indices\" : [ { \"module\" : \"ENTITY-MIB\" , \"object\" : \"entPhysicalIndex\" , \"implied\" : 0 }, { \"module\" : \"ENTITY-MIB\" , \"object\" : \"entPhysicalChildIndex\" , \"implied\" : 0 } ], \"status\" : \"current\" , \"description\" : \"A single container/'containee' relationship.\" }, Sometimes indexes are columns from another table, and we might want to use another column as it could have more human readable information - we might prefer to see the interface name vs its numerical table index.

Create cards for changes between a previous Agent release and master (useful when preparing an initial RC): $ ddev release trello testable 7.16.1 origin/master Create cards for changes between a previous RC and master (useful when preparing a new RC, and a separate release branch was not created yet): $ ddev release trello testable 7.17.0-rc.2 origin/master Create cards for changes between a previous RC and a release branch (useful to only review changes in a release branch that has diverged from master ): $ ddev release trello testable 7.17.0-rc.4 7.17.x Create cards for changes between two arbitrary tags, e.g. between RCs: $ ddev release trello testable 7.17.0-rc.4 7.17.0-rc.5 TIP: run with ddev -x release trello testable to force the use of the current directory.

Style \u00b6 Setting dd_check_style to true will enable 2 environments for enforcing our style conventions : style - This will check the formatting and will error if any issues are found. You may use the -s/--style flag of ddev test to execute only this environment. format_style - This will format the code for you, resolving the most common issues caught by style environment. You can run the formatter by using the -fs/--format-style flag of ddev test . pytest \u00b6 Our pytest plugin makes a few fixtures available globally for use during tests. Also, it's responsible for managing the control flow of E2E environments. Fixtures \u00b6 Agent stubs \u00b6 The stubs provided by each fixture will automatically have their state reset before each test. aggregator datadog_agent Check execution \u00b6 Most tests will execute checks via the run method of the AgentCheck interface (if the check is stateful ). A consequence of this is that, unlike the check method, exceptions are not propagated to the caller meaning not only can an exception not be asserted, but also errors are silently ignored. The dd_run_check fixture takes a check instance and executes it while also propagating any exceptions like normal. def test_metrics ( aggregator , dd_run_check ): check = AwesomeCheck ( 'awesome' , {}, [{ 'port' : 8080 }]) dd_run_check ( check ) ... You can use the extract_message option to condense any exception message to just the original message rather than the full traceback. def test_config ( dd_run_check ): check = AwesomeCheck ( 'awesome' , {}, [{ 'port' : 'foo' }]) with pytest . raises ( Exception , match = '^Option `port` must be an integer$' ): dd_run_check ( check , extract_message = True ) E2E \u00b6 Agent check runner \u00b6 The dd_agent_check fixture will run the integration with a given configuration on a live Agent and return a populated aggregator . It accepts a single dict configuration representing either: a single instance a full configuration with top level keys instances , init_config , etc. Internally, this is a wrapper around ddev env check and you can pass through any supported options or flags. This fixture can only be used from tests marked as e2e . For example: @pytest . mark . e2e def test_e2e_metrics ( dd_agent_check , instance ): aggregator = dd_agent_check ( instance , rate = True ) ... State \u00b6 Occasionally, you will need to persist some data only known at the time of environment creation (like a generated token) through the test and environment tear down phases. To do so, use the following fixtures: dd_save_state - When executing the necessary steps to spin up an environment you may use this to save any object that can be serialized to JSON. For example: dd_save_state ( 'my_data' , { 'foo' : 'bar' }) dd_get_state - This may be used to retrieve the data: my_data = dd_get_state ( 'my_data' , default = {}) Mock HTTP response \u00b6 The mock_http_response fixture mocks HTTP requests for the lifetime of a test. The fixture can be used to mock the response of an endpoint. In the following example, we can mock the Prometheus output. def test ( mock_http_response ): mock_http_response ( \"\"\" # HELP go_memstats_alloc_bytes Number of bytes allocated and still in use. # TYPE go_memstats_alloc_bytes gauge go_memstats_alloc_bytes 6.396288e+06 \"\"\" ) ... Environment manager \u00b6 The fixture dd_environment_runner manages communication between environments and the ddev env command group. You will never use it directly as it runs automatically. It acts upon a fixture named dd_environment that every integration's test suite will define if E2E testing on a live Agent is desired. This fixture is responsible for starting and stopping environments and must adhere to the following requirements: It yield s a single dict representing the default configuration the Agent will use. It must be either: a single instance a full configuration with top level keys instances , init_config , etc. Additionally, you can pass a second dict containing metadata . The setup logic must occur before the yield and the tear down logic must occur after it. Also, both steps must only execute based on the value of environment variables. Setup - only if DDEV_E2E_UP is not set to false Tear down - only if DDEV_E2E_DOWN is not set to false Note The provided Docker and Terraform environment runner utilities will do this automatically for you. Metadata \u00b6 env_type - This is the type of interface that will be used to interact with the Agent. Currently, we support docker (default) and local . env_vars - A dict of environment variables and their values that will be present when starting the Agent. docker_volumes - A list of str representing Docker volume mounts if env_type is docker e.g. /local/path:/agent/container/path:ro . docker_platform - The container architecture to use if env_type is docker .

For such cases, you'll want to spin up an environment and gracefully tear it down when tests finish. We define all environment actions in a fixture called dd_environment that looks semantically like this: @pytest . fixture ( scope = 'session' ) def dd_environment (): try : set_up_env () yield some_default_config finally : tear_down_env () This is not only used for regular tests, but is also the basis of our E2E testing . The start command executes everything before the yield and the stop command executes everything after it. We provide a few utilities for common environment types. Docker \u00b6 The docker_run utility makes it easy to create services using docker-compose . from datadog_checks.dev import docker_run @pytest . fixture ( scope = 'session' ) def dd_environment (): with docker_run ( os . path . join ( HERE , 'docker' , 'compose.yaml' )): yield ... Read the reference for more information. Terraform \u00b6 The terraform_run utility makes it easy to create services from a directory of Terraform files. from datadog_checks.dev.terraform import terraform_run @pytest . fixture ( scope = 'session' ) def dd_environment (): with terraform_run ( os . path . join ( HERE , 'terraform' )): yield ... Currently, we only use this for services that would be too complex to setup with Docker (like OpenStack) or things that cannot be provided by Docker (like vSphere). We provide some ready-to-use cloud templates that are available for referencing by default. We prefer using GCP when possible. Terraform E2E tests are not run in our public CI as that would needlessly slow down builds. Read the reference for more information. Mocker \u00b6 The mocker fixture is provided by the pytest-mock plugin. This fixture automatically restores anything that was mocked at the end of each test and is more ergonomic to use than stacking decorators or nesting context managers. Here's an example from their docs: def test_foo ( mocker ): # all valid calls mocker . patch ( 'os.remove' ) mocker . patch . object ( os , 'listdir' , autospec = True ) mocked_isfile = mocker . patch ( 'os.path.isfile' ) It also has many other nice features, like using pytest introspection when comparing calls. Benchmarks \u00b6 The benchmark fixture is provided by the pytest-benchmark plugin. It enables the profiling of functions with the low-overhead cProfile module. It is quite useful for seeing the approximate time a given check takes to run, as well as gaining insight into any potential performance bottlenecks. You would use it like this: def test_large_payload ( benchmark , dd_run_check ): check = AwesomeCheck ( 'awesome' , {}, [ instance ]) # Run once to get any initialization out of the way. dd_run_check ( check ) benchmark ( dd_run_check , check ) To add benchmarks, define environments in tox.ini with bench somewhere in their names: [tox] ... envlist = ... bench ... [testenv:bench] By default, the test command skips all benchmark environments. To run only benchmark environments use the --bench / -b flag. The results are sorted by tottime , which is the total time spent in the given function (and excluding time made in calls to sub-functions). Logs \u00b6 We provide an easy way to utilize log collection with E2E Docker environments . Pass mount_logs=True to docker_run . This will use the logs example in the integration's config spec . For example, the following defines 2 example log files: - template : logs example : - type : file path : /var/log/apache2/access.log source : apache service : apache - type : file path : /var/log/apache2/error.log source : apache service : apache Alternatives If mount_logs is a sequence of int , only the selected indices (starting at 1) will be used. So, using the Apache example above, to only monitor the error log you would set it to [2] . In lieu of a config spec, for whatever reason, you may set mount_logs to a dict containing the standard logs key. All requested log files are available to reference as environment variables for any Docker calls as DD_LOG_<LOG_CONFIG_INDEX> where the indices start at 1. volumes : - ${DD_LOG_1}:/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log - ${DD_LOG_2}:/usr/local/apache2/logs/error_log When starting the environment, pass -e DD_LOGS_ENABLED=true to activate the Logs Agent.

Integration Preset Dashboards \u00b6 If you would like to create a default dashboard for an integration, follow the guidelines in the Best Practices section. Exporting a dashboard payload \u00b6 When you've created a dashboard in the Datadog UI, you can export the dashboard payload to be included in its integration's assets directory. Ensure that you have set an api_key and app_key for the org that contains the new dashboard in the ddev configuration . Run the following command to export the dashboard : ddev meta dash export <URL_OF_DASHBOARD> <INTEGRATION> Tip If the dashboard is for a contributor-maintained integration in the integration-extras repo, run the command with the --extras or -e flag. The command will add the dashboard definition to the manifest.json file of the integration. The dashboard JSON payload will be available in /assets/dashboards/<DASHBOARD_TITLE>.json . Commit the changes and create a pull request. Verify the Preset Dashboard \u00b6 Once your PR is merged and synced on production, you can find your dashboard in the Dashboard List page. Tip Make sure the integration tile is Installed in order to see the preset dashboard in the list. Ensure logos render correctly on the Dashboard List page and within the preset dashboard. Best Practices \u00b6 Example of a great integration dashboard \u00b6 Attention-grabbing \"about\" section with a banner image, concise copy, useful links, and a good typography hierarchy A brief, annotated \"overview\" section with the most important statistics, right at the top Simple graph titles and title-case group names Nearly symmetrical in high density mode Well formatted, concise notes Color coordination between related groups, notes within groups, and graphs within groups Follow the guidelines below as you build your dashboard to achieve something similar. General \u00b6 When creating a new dashboard, select the default dashboard type (internally called multisize layout). Dashboard titles should contain the integration name. Some examples of a good dashboard title are Syclla and Cilium Overview . Warning Avoid using - (hyphen) in the dashboard title as the dashboard URL is generated from the title. Add a logo to the dashboard header. The integration logo will automatically appear in the header if the icon exists here and the integration_id matches the icon name. That means it will only appear when the dashboard you're working on is made into the official integration board. Always include an \"about\" group for the integration containing a brief description and helpful links. Also include an \"overview\" group containing a few of the most important metrics, and place it at the top of the dashboard. Edit the \"about\" group and select the \"banner\" display option, then link to a banner image like this: /static/images/integration_dashboard/your-image.png . For instructions on how to create and upload a banner image, go to the DRUIDS logo gallery , click the relevant logo, and click the \"MSL Dashboard\" tab. The \"about\" section should contain content, not data; the \"overview\" section should contain data. Avoid making the \"about\" section full-width. Research the metrics supported by the integration and consider grouping them in relevant categories. Important metrics that are key to the performance and overview of the integration should be at the top. Use Group widgets to title and group sections, rather than note widgets as you might on a screenboard. Use partial width groups to display groups side-by-side. Most dashboards should display every widget within a group. Timeseries widgets should be at least 4 columns wide in order not to appear squashed on smaller displays Stream widgets should be at least 6 columns wide (half the dashboard width) for readability. You should place them at the end of a dashboard so they don't \"trap\" scrolling. It's useful to put stream widgets in a group by themselves so they can be collapsed. Add an event stream only if the service monitored by the dashboard is reporting events. Use sources:service_name . Which widgets best represent your data? Try using a mix of widget types and sizes. Explore visualizations and formatting options until you're confident your dashboard is as clear as it can be. Sometimes a whole dashboard of timeseries is ok, but other times variety can improve things. The most commonly used metric widgets are timeseries , query values , and tables . For more information on the available widget types, see the list of supported dashboard widgets . Try to make the left and right halves of your dashboard symmetrical in high density mode. Users with large monitors will see your dashboard in high density mode by default, so it's important to make sure the group relationships make sense, and the dashboard looks good. You can adjust group heights to achieve this, and move groups between the left and right halves. a. (perfectly symmetrical) b. (close enough) Template variables allow you to dynamically filter one or more widgets in a dashboard. Template variables must be universal and accessible by any user or account using the monitored service. Make sure all relevant graphs are listening to the relevant template variable filters. Tip Adding *=scope as a template variable is useful since users can access all their own tags. Copy \u00b6 Prefer concise graph titles that start with the most important information. Avoid common phrases such as \"number of\", and don't include the integration title e.g. \"Memcached Load\". Concise title (good) Verbose title (bad) Events per node Number of Kubernetes events per node Pending tasks: [$node_name] Total number of pending tasks in [$node_name] Read/write operations Number of read/write operations Connections to server - rate Rate of connections to server Load Memcached Load Avoid repeating the group title or integration name in every widget in a group, especially if the widgets are query values with a custom unit of the same name. Note the word \"shards\" in each widget title in the group named \"shards\". Always alias formulas Group titles should be title case. Widget titles should be sentence case. If you're showing a legend, make sure the aliases are easy to understand. Graph titles should summarize the queried metric. Do not indicate the unit in the graph title because unit types are displayed automatically from metadata. An exception to this is if the calculation of the query represents a different type of unit. QA \u00b6 Always check a dashboard at 1280px wide and 2560px wide to see how it looks on a smaller laptop and a larger monitor. The most common screen widths for dashboards are 1920, 1680, 1440, 2560, and 1280px, making up more than half of all dashboard page views combined. Tip If your monitor isn't large enough for high density mode, use the browser zoom controls to zoom out. Visual Style \u00b6 Format notes to make them fit their use case. Try the presets \"caption\", \"annotation\", or \"header\", or pick your own combination of styles. Avoid using the smallest font size for notes that are long or include complex formatting, like bulleted lists or code blocks. Use colors to highlight important relationships and to improve readability, not for style. If several groups are related, apply the same group header color to all of them. If you've applied a green header color to a group, try making its notes green as well. If two groups are related, but one is more important, try using the \"vivid\" color on the important group and the \"light\" color on the less important group. Don't be afraid to leave groups with white headers, and be careful not to overuse color e.g. don't make every group on a dashboard vivid blue. Also avoid using gray headers. Use legends when they make sense. Legends make it easy to read a graph without having to hover over each series or maximize the widget. Make sure you use aliases so the legend is easy to read. Automatic mode for legends is a great option that hides legends when space is tight and shows them when there's room. If you want users to compare two graphs side-by-side, make sure their x-axes align. If one graph is showing a legend and the other isn't, the x-axes won't align - make sure they either both show a legend or both do not. For timeseries, base the display type on the type of metric Types of metric Display type Volume (e.g. Number of connections) area Counts (e.g. Number of errors) bars Multiple groups or default lines","title":"Dashboards"},{"location":"guidelines/dashboards/#dashboards","text":"Datadog dashboards enable you to efficiently monitor your infrastructure and integrations by displaying and tracking key metrics.","title":"Dashboards"},{"location":"guidelines/dashboards/#integration-preset-dashboards","text":"If you would like to create a default dashboard for an integration, follow the guidelines in the Best Practices section.","title":"Integration Preset Dashboards"},{"location":"guidelines/dashboards/#exporting-a-dashboard-payload","text":"When you've created a dashboard in the Datadog UI, you can export the dashboard payload to be included in its integration's assets directory.

We use the 5 standard sections: __future__ , stdlib, third party, first party, and local. datadog_checks is configured as a first party namespace. flake8 \u00b6 An easy-to-use wrapper around pycodestyle and pyflakes . We select everything it provides and only ignore a few things to give precedence to other tools. bugbear \u00b6 A flake8 plugin for finding likely bugs and design problems in programs. We enable: B001 : Do not use bare except: , it also catches unexpected events like memory errors, interrupts, system exit, and so on. Prefer except Exception: . B003 : Assigning to os.environ doesn't clear the environment. Subprocesses are going to see outdated variables, in disagreement with the current process. Use os.environ.clear() or the env= argument to Popen. B006 : Do not use mutable data structures for argument defaults. All calls reuse one instance of that data structure, persisting changes between them. B007 : Loop control variable not used within the loop body. If this is intended, start the name with an underscore. B301 : Python 3 does not include .iter* methods on dictionaries. The default behavior is to return iterables. Simply remove the iter prefix from the method. For Python 2 compatibility, also prefer the Python 3 equivalent if you expect that the size of the dict to be small and bounded. The performance regression on Python 2 will be negligible and the code is going to be the clearest. Alternatively, use six.iter* . B305 : .next() is not a thing on Python 3. Use the next() builtin. For Python 2 compatibility, use six.next() . B306 : BaseException.message has been deprecated as of Python 2.6 and is removed in Python 3. Use str(e) to access the user-readable message. Use e.args to access arguments passed to the exception. B902 : Invalid first argument used for method.

This is optional for now. In order to enable mypy for a specific integration, open its tox.ini file and add the 2 lines in the correct section: [testenv] dd_check_types = true dd_mypy_args = <FLAGS> --py2 datadog_checks/ tests/ ... The dd_mypy_args defines the mypy command line option for this specific integration. --py2 is here to make sure the integration is Python2.7 compatible. Here are some useful flags you can add: --check-untyped-defs : Type-checks the interior of functions without type annotations. --disallow-untyped-defs : Disallows defining functions without type annotations or with incomplete type annotations. The datadog_checks/ tests/ arguments represent the list of files that mypy should type check.

Windows-only integrations run on Windows Server 2019 with Visual Studio 2019 All other integrations run on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Some things are tested on multiple platforms, like the base package and the Disk check. Pipelines \u00b6 Pull requests \u00b6 Every commit to a branch tied to an open pull request triggers a Linux and Windows job . Each runner will test any integration that was changed , with the Windows runner being further restricted to Windows-only integrations. If the base package is modified, jobs will be triggered for every integration, similar to the pipeline for master . Master \u00b6 Every commit to the master branch triggers one or more jobs for every integration . Scripts \u00b6 Some integrations require additional set up such as the installation of system dependencies. As we only want these extra steps to occur when necessary, there is a stage ran for every job that will detect what needs to be done and execute the appropriate scripts . As integrations may need different set up on different platforms, all scripts live under a directory named after the platform. All scripts in the directory will be executed in lexicographical order. Validations \u00b6 In addition to running tests on our CI, there are also some validations that are run to check for correctness of changes to various components of integrations. If any of these validations fail on your branch, then the CI will fail. In short, each validation is a ddev command, which fails if the component it is validating is not correct. See the ddev documentation and source code for the full docs for each validation. Tip A list of the current validations can be found here . CI configuration \u00b6 ddev validate ci This validates that all CI entries for integrations are valid. This includes checking if the integration has the correct codecov config, and has a valid CI entry if it is testable. Tip Run ddev validate ci --fix to resolve most errors. Agent requirements \u00b6 ddev validate agent-reqs This validates that each integration version is in sync with the requirements-agent-release.txt file. It is uncommon for this to fail because the release process is automated. Codeowners \u00b6 ddev validate codeowners This validates that every integration has a codeowner entry . If you fail this validation, add an entry in the codewners file corresponding to any newly added integration. Note: This validation command is only run when contributing to integrations-extras Default configuration files \u00b6 ddev validate config This verifies that the config specs for all integrations are valid by enforcing our configuration spec schema . The most common failure at this validation stage is some version of File <INTEGRATION_SPEC> needs to be synced. To resolve this issue, you can run ddev validate config --sync If you see failures regarding formatting or missing parameters, see our config spec documentation for more details on how to construct configuration specs. Dashboard definition files \u00b6 ddev validate dashboards This validates that dashboards are formatted correctly. This means that they need to be proper JSON and generated from Datadog's /dashboard API . Tip If you see a failure regarding use of the screen endpoint, consider using our dashboard utility command to generate your dashboard payload. Dependencies \u00b6 ddev validate dep This command: Verifies the uniqueness of dependency versions across all checks. Verifies all the dependencies are pinned. Verifies the embedded Python environment defined in the base check and requirements listed in every integration are compatible. This validation only applies if your work introduces new external dependencies. Manifest files \u00b6 ddev validate manifest This validates that the manifest files contain required fields, are formatted correctly, and don't contain common errors. See the Datadog docs for more detailed constraints. Metadata \u00b6 ddev validate metadata This checks that every metadata.csv file is formatted correctly. See the Datadog docs for more detailed constraints. README files \u00b6 ddev validate readmes This ensures that every integration's README.md file is formatted correctly. The main purpose of this validation is to ensure that any image linked in the readme exists and that all images are located in an integration's /image directory. Saved views data \u00b6 ddev validate saved-views This validates that saved views for an integration are formatted correctly and contain required fields, such as \"type\". Tip View example saved views for inspiration and guidance. Service check data \u00b6 ddev validate service-checks This checks that every service check file is formatted correctly. See the Datadog docs for more specific constraints. Imports \u00b6 ddev validate imports This verifies that all integrations import the base package in the correct way, such as: from datadog_checks.base.foo import bar Tip See the New Integration Instructions for more examples of how to use the base package.

Producer \u00b6 The producer 's job is to read a specification and: Validate for correctness Populate all unset default fields Resolve any defined templates Output the complete specification as JSON for arbitrary consumers Consumers \u00b6 Consumers may utilize specs in a number of scenarios, such as: rendering example configuration shipped to end users documenting all options in-app & on the docs site form for creating configuration in multiple formats on Integration tiles automatic configuration loading for Checks Agent based and/or in-app validator for user-supplied configuration Schema \u00b6 The root of every spec is a map with 3 keys: name - The display name of what the spec refers to e.g. Postgres , Datadog Agent , etc. version - The released version of what the spec refers to files - A list of all files that influence behavior Files \u00b6 Every file has 3 possible attributes: name - This is the name of the file the Agent will look for ( REQUIRED ) example_name - This is the name of the example file the Agent will ship. If none is provided, the default will be conf.yaml.example . The exception is auto-discovery files, which are also named auto_conf.yaml . options - A list of options ( REQUIRED ) Options \u00b6 Every option has 10 possible attributes: name - This is the name of the option ( REQUIRED ) description - Information about the option ( REQUIRED ) required - Whether or not the option is required for basic functionality. It defaults to false . hidden - Whether or not the option should not be publicly exposed. It defaults to false . display_priority - An integer representing the relative visual rank the option should take on compared to other options when publicly exposed. It defaults to 0 , meaning that every option will be displayed in the order defined in the spec. deprecation - If the option is deprecated, a mapping of relevant information. For example: deprecation : Release : 8.0.0 Migration : | do this and that multiple - Whether or not options may be selected multiple times like instances or just once like init_config multiple_instances_defined - Whether or not we separate the definition into multiple instances or just one metadata_tags - A list of tags (like docs:foo ) that can be used for unexpected use cases options - Nested options, indicating that this is a section like instances or logs value - The expected type data There are 2 types of options: those with and without a value . Those with a value attribute are the actual user-controlled settings that influence behavior like username . Those without are expected to be sections and therefore must have an options attribute. An option cannot have both attributes. Options with a value (non-section) also support: secret - Whether or not consumers should treat the option as sensitive information like password . It defaults to false . Info The option vs section logic was chosen instead of going fully typed to avoid deeply nested value s. Values \u00b6 The type system is based on a loose subset of OpenAPI 3 data types . The differences are: Only the minimum and maximum numeric modifiers are supported Only the pattern string modifier is supported The properties object modifier is not a map, but rather a list of maps with a required name attribute. This is so consumers will load objects consistently regardless of language guarantees regarding map key order. Values also support 1 field of our own: example - An example value, only required if the type is boolean . The default is <OPTION_NAME> . Templates \u00b6 Every option may reference pre-defined templates using a key called template . The template format looks like path/to/template_file where path/to must point an existing directory relative to a template directory and template_file must have the file extension .yaml or .yml . You can use custom templates that will take precedence over the pre-defined templates by using the template_paths parameter of the ConfigSpec class. Override \u00b6 For occasions when deeply nested default template values need to be overridden, there is the ability to redefine attributes via a .

It respects a few extra option -level attributes: example - A complete example of an option in lieu of a strictly typed value attribute enabled - Whether or not to un-comment the option, overriding the behavior of required display_priority - This is an integer affecting the order in which options are displayed, with higher values indicating higher priority. The default is 0 . It also respects a few extra fields under the value attribute of each option: display_default - This is the default value that will be shown in the header of each option, useful if it differs from the example . You may set it to null explicitly to disable showing this part of the header. compact_example - Whether or not to display complex types like arrays in their most compact representation. It defaults to false . Usage \u00b6 Use the --sync flag of the config validation command to render the example configuration files. Data model consumer \u00b6 The model consumer uses each spec to render the pydantic models that checks use to validate and interface with configuration. The models are shipped with every Agent and individual Integration release. It respects an extra field under the value attribute of each option: default - This is the default value that options will be set to, taking precedence over the example . validators - This refers to an array of pre-defined field validators to use.

Many integrations are actively developed and released often while some are rarely touched (usually indicating feature-completeness). Versioning \u00b6 All releases adhere to Semantic Versioning . Tags in the form <INTEGRATION_NAME>-<VERSION> are added to the Git repository. Therefore, it's possible to checkout and build the code for a certain version of a specific check. Setup \u00b6 Configure your GitHub auth. Identify changes \u00b6 Note If you already know which integration you'd like to release, skip this section. To see all checks that need to be released, run ddev release show ready . Checkout and pull the most recent version of the master branch. git checkout master git pull Important Not using the latest version of master may cause errors in the build pipeline . Review which PRs were merged in between the latest release and the master branch. ddev release show changes <INTEGRATION> You should ensure that PR titles and changelog labels are correct. Creating the release \u00b6 Create a release branch from master (suggested naming format is <USERNAME>/release-<INTEGRATION_NAME> ). This has the purpose of opening a PR so others can review the changelog. Important It is critical the branch name is not in the form <USERNAME>/<INTEGRATION_NAME>-<NEW_VERSION> because one of our Gitlab jobs is triggered whenever a Git reference matches that pattern, see !3843 & !3980 . Make the release. Core \u00b6 ddev release make <INTEGRATION> You may need to touch your Yubikey multiple times. This will automatically: update the version in <INTEGRATION>/datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION>/__about__.py update the changelog update the requirements-agent-release.txt file update in-toto metadata commit the above changes Third party \u00b6 Update the version on datadog_checks/<INTEGRATION>/__about__.py . Update the CHANGELOG.md file This file can be automatically updated by ddev using the following command: ddev release changelog <INTEGRATION_NAME> <VERSION> This command will list all merged PRs since the last release and creates a changelog entry based on the pull request labels, this means that the version bump needs to be on a separate PR from the one that included the changes . For changelog types, we adhere to those defined by Keep a Changelog . | Push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request. Update the title of the PR to something like [Release] Bumped <INTEGRATION> version to <VERSION> . Ask for a review in Slack. Merge the pull request after approval or wait for it to be merged. Metadata \u00b6 You need to run certain backend jobs if any changes modified integration metadata or assets such as dashboards. If you are a contributor a datadog employee will handle this. Bulk releases (core integrations only) \u00b6 To create a release for every integration that has changed, use all as the integration name in the ddev release make step above. ddev release make all You may also pass a comma-separated list of checks to skip using the --exclude option, e.g.: ddev release make all --exclude datadog_checks_dev Warning There is a known GitHub limitation where if an issue has too many labels (100), its state cannot be modified. If you cannot merge the pull request: Run the remove-labels command After merging, manually add back the changelog/no-changelog label Betas (core integrations only) \u00b6 Creating pre-releases follows the same workflow except you do not open a pull request but rather release directly from a branch. In the ddev release make step set --version to [major|minor|patch],[rc|alpha|beta] . For example, if the current version of an integration is 1.1.3 , the following command will bump it to 1.2.0-rc.1 : ddev release make <INTEGRATION> --version minor,rc After pushing the release commits to GitHub, run: ddev release tag <INTEGRATION> This manually triggers the build pipeline . To increment the version, omit the first part, e.g.: ddev release make <INTEGRATION> --version rc New integrations \u00b6 Core integrations \u00b6 To bump a new core integration to 1.0.0 if it is not already there, run: ddev release make <INTEGRATION> --new To ensure this for all integrations, run: ddev release make all --new If a release was created, run: ddev agent requirements Third party integrations \u00b6 For first time releases of third party integrations, simply merge the integration to master and a release will be triggered with the specified version number in the about file. Base package releases \u00b6 If you released datadog_checks_base or datadog_checks_dev then these must be uploaded to PyPI for use by integrations-extras . This is automatically handled by two GitHub Action jobs: release-base.yml and release-dev.yml . In case you need to do it manually: ddev release upload datadog_checks_[base|dev] Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you encounter errors when signing with your Yubikey, ensure you ran gpg --import <YOUR_KEY_ID>.gpg.pub . If the build pipeline failed, it is likely that you modified a file in the pull request without re-signing. To resolve this, you'll need to bootstrap metadata for every integration: Checkout and pull the most recent version of the master branch. git checkout master git pull Sign everything. ddev release make all --sign-only You may need to touch your Yubikey multiple times. Push your branch to GitHub. Manually trigger a build. git tag <USERNAME>bootstrap-1.0.0 -m <USERNAME>bootstrap-1.0.0 The tag name is irrelevant, it just needs to look like an integration release. Gitlab doesn't sync deleted tags, so any subsequent manual trigger tags will need to increment the version number. Delete the branch and tag, locally and on GitHub. Releasers \u00b6 For whom it may concern, the following is a list of GPG public key fingerprints known to correspond to developers who, at the time of writing (28-02-2020), can trigger a build by signing in-toto metadata .

Our approach is to use a simulated SNMP device that responds to SNMP queries using simulation data . This simulated device is brought up as a Docker container when starting the SNMP test environment using: ddev env start snmp [ ... ] Test SNMP profiles locally \u00b6 Once the environment is up and running, you can modify the instance configuration to test profiles that support simulated metrics. The following is an example of an instance configured to use the Cisco Nexus profile. init_config : profiles : cisco_nexus : definition_file : cisco-nexus.yaml instances : - community_string : cisco_nexus # (1.) ip_address : <IP_ADDRESS_OF_SNMP_CONTAINER> # (2.) profile : cisco_nexus name : localhost port : 1161 The community_string must match the corresponding device .snmprec file name. For example, myprofile.snmprec gives community_string: myprofile . This also applies to walk files : myprofile.snmpwalk gives community_string: myprofile . To find the IP address of the SNMP container, run: docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' dd-snmp Run SNMP queries \u00b6 With the test environment is up and running, we can issue SNMP queries to the simulated device using a command line SNMP client. Prerequisites \u00b6 Make sure you have the Net-SNMP tools installed on your machine. These should come pre-installed by default on Linux and macOS. If necessary, you can download them on the Net-SNMP website . Available commands \u00b6 The Net-SNMP tools provide a number of commands to interact with SNMP devices. The most commonly used commands are: snmpget : to issue an SNMP GET query. snmpgetnext : to issue an SNMP GETNEXT query. snmpwalk : to query an entire OID sub-tree at once. snmptable : to query rows in an SNMP table. Examples \u00b6 GET query \u00b6 To query a specific OID from a device, we can use the snmpget command. For example, the following command will query sysDescr OID of an SNMP device, which returns its human-readable description: $ snmpget -v 2c -c public -IR 127 .0.0.1:1161 system.sysDescr.0 SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Linux 41ba948911b9 4.9.87-linuxkit-aufs #1 SMP Wed Mar 14 15:12:16 UTC 2018 x86_64 SNMPv2-MIB::sysORUpTime.1 = Timeticks: (9) 0:00:00.09 Let's break this command down: snmpget : this command sends an SNMP GET request, and can be used to query the value of an OID. Here, we are requesting the system.sysDescr.0 OID. -v 2c : instructs your SNMP client to send the request using SNMP version 2c. See SNMP Versions . -c public : instructs the SNMP client to send the community string public along with our request. (This is a form of authentication provided by SNMP v2. See SNMP Versions .) 127.0.0.1:1161 : this is the host and port where the simulated SNMP agent is available at. (Confirm the port used by the ddev environment by inspecting the Docker port mapping via $ docker ps .) system.sysDescr.0 : this is the OID that the client should request. In practice this can refer to either a fully-resolved OID (e.g. 1.3.6.1.4.1[...] ), or a label (e.g. sysDescr.0 ). -IR : this option allows us to use labels for OIDs that aren't in the generic 1.3.6.1.2.1.* sub-tree (see: The OID tree ). TL;DR: always use this option when working with OIDs coming from vendor-specific MIBs. Tip If the above command fails, try using the explicit OID like so: $ snmpget -v 2c -c public -IR 127 .0.0.1:1161 iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 Table query \u00b6 For tables, use the snmptable command, which will output the rows in the table in a tabular format. Its arguments and options are similar to snmpget . $ snmptable -v 2c -c public -IR -Os 127 .0.0.1:1161 hrStorageTable SNMP table: hrStorageTable hrStorageIndex hrStorageType hrStorageDescr hrStorageAllocationUnits hrStorageSize hrStorageUsed hrStorageAllocationFailures 1 hrStorageRam Physical memory 1024 Bytes 2046940 1969964 ? 3 hrStorageVirtualMemory Virtual memory 1024 Bytes 3095512 1969964 ? 6 hrStorageOther Memory buffers 1024 Bytes 2046940 73580 ? 7 hrStorageOther Cached memory 1024 Bytes 1577648 1577648 ? 8 hrStorageOther Shared memory 1024 Bytes 2940 2940 ? 10 hrStorageVirtualMemory Swap space 1024 Bytes 1048572 0 ? 33 hrStorageFixedDisk /dev 4096 Bytes 16384 0 ? 36 hrStorageFixedDisk /sys/fs/cgroup 4096 Bytes 255867 0 ? 52 hrStorageFixedDisk /etc/resolv.conf 4096 Bytes 16448139 6493059 ? 53 hrStorageFixedDisk /etc/hostname 4096 Bytes 16448139 6493059 ? 54 hrStorageFixedDisk /etc/hosts 4096 Bytes 16448139 6493059 ? 55 hrStorageFixedDisk /dev/shm 4096 Bytes 16384 0 ? 61 hrStorageFixedDisk /proc/kcore 4096 Bytes 16384 0 ? 62 hrStorageFixedDisk /proc/keys 4096 Bytes 16384 0 ? 63 hrStorageFixedDisk /proc/timer_list 4096 Bytes 16384 0 ? 64 hrStorageFixedDisk /proc/sched_debug 4096 Bytes 16384 0 ? 65 hrStorageFixedDisk /sys/firmware 4096 Bytes 255867 0 ? (In this case, we added the -Os option which prints only the last symbolic element and reduces the output of hrStorageTypes .) Walk query \u00b6 A walk query can be used to query all OIDs in a given sub-tree . The snmpwalk command can be used to perform a walk query. To facilitate usage of walk files for debugging, the following options are recommended: -ObentU . Here's what each option does: b : do not break OID indexes down. e : print enums numerically (for example, 24 instead of softwareLoopback(24) ). n : print OIDs numerically (for example, .1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1 instead of IF-MIB::ifIndex.1 ). t : print timeticks numerically (for example, 4226041 instead of Timeticks: (4226041) 11:44:20.41 ). U : don't print units. For example, the following command gets a walk of the 1.3.6.1.2.1.1 ( system ) sub-tree: $ snmpwalk -v 2c -c public -ObentU 127 .0.0.1:1161 1 .3.6.1.2.1.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 = STRING: Linux 41ba948911b9 4.9.87-linuxkit-aufs #1 SMP Wed Mar 14 15:12:16 UTC 2018 x86_64 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 = OID: .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 = 4226041 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0 = STRING: root@localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 = STRING: 41ba948911b9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0 = STRING: Unknown .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.0 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.1 = OID: .1.3.6.1.6.3.11.3.1.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.2 = OID: .1.3.6.1.6.3.15.2.1.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.3 = OID: .1.3.6.1.6.3.10.3.1.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.4 = OID: .1.3.6.1.6.3.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.5 = OID: .1.3.6.1.2.1.49 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.6 = OID: .1.3.6.1.2.1.4 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.7 = OID: .1.3.6.1.2.1.50 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.8 = OID: .1.3.6.1.6.3.16.2.2.1 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.9 = OID: .1.3.6.1.6.3.13.3.1.3 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.2.10 = OID: .1.3.6.1.2.1.92 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.1 = STRING: The MIB for Message Processing and Dispatching. .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.2 = STRING: The management information definitions for the SNMP User-based Security Model. .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.3 = STRING: The SNMP Management Architecture MIB. .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.4 = STRING: The MIB module for SNMPv2 entities .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.5 = STRING: The MIB module for managing TCP implementations .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.6 = STRING: The MIB module for managing IP and ICMP implementations .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.7 = STRING: The MIB module for managing UDP implementations .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.8 = STRING: View-based Access Control Model for SNMP. .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.9 = STRING: The MIB modules for managing SNMP Notification, plus filtering. .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.3.10 = STRING: The MIB module for logging SNMP Notifications. .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.1 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.2 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.3 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.4 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.5 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.6 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.7 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.8 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.9 = 9 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.9.1.4.10 = 9 As you can see, all OIDs that the device has available in the .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.* sub-tree are returned.

This tool will be renamed as snmpsim-record-mibs in the upcoming 1.0 release of the library. First, install snmpsim: pip install snmpsim Then run the tool, specifying the MIB with the start and stop OIDs (which can correspond to .e.g the first and last columns in the table respectively). For example: mib2dev.py --mib-module = <MIB> --start-oid = 1 .3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.400.20 --stop-oid = 1 .3.6.1.4.1.674.10892.1.600.12 > /path/to/mytable.snmprec The following command generates 4 rows for the IF-MIB:ifTable (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2) : mib2dev.py --mib-module = IF-MIB --start-oid = 1 .3.6.1.2.1.2.2 --stop-oid = 1 .3.6.1.2.1.2.3 --table-size = 4 > /path/to/mytable.snmprec Known issues \u00b6 mib2dev has a known issue with IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress , that is expected to contain an hexadecimal string, but mib2dev fills it with a string. To fix this, provide a valid hextring when prompted on the command line: # Synthesizing row #1 of table 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1 *** Inconsistent value: Display format eval failure: b 'driving kept zombies quaintly forward zombies' : invalid literal for int () with base 16 : 'driving kept zombies quaintly forward zombies' caused by <class 'ValueError' >: invalid literal for int () with base 16 : 'driving kept zombies quaintly forward zombies' *** See constraints and suggest a better one for : # Table IF-MIB::ifTable # Row IF-MIB::ifEntry # Index IF-MIB::ifIndex (type InterfaceIndex) # Column IF-MIB::ifPhysAddress (type PhysAddress) # Value ['driving kept zombies quaintly forward zombies'] ? 001122334455 Generate simulation data from a walk \u00b6 As an alternative to .snmprec files , it is possible to use a walk as simulation data . This is especially useful when debugging live devices, since you can export the device walk and use this real data locally. To do so, paste the output of a walk query into a .snmpwalk file, and add this file to the test data directory. Then, pass the name of the walk file as the community_string . For more information, see Test SNMP profiles locally . Find where MIBs are installed on your machine \u00b6 See the Using and loading MIBs Net-SNMP tutorial. Browse locally installed MIBs \u00b6 Since community resources that list MIBs and OIDs are best effort, the MIB you are investigating may not be present or may not be available in its the latest version. In that case, you can use the snmptranslate CLI tool to output similar information for MIBs installed on your system. This tool is part of Net-SNMP - see SNMP queries prerequisites . Steps Run $ snmptranslate -m <MIBNAME> -Tz -On to get a complete list of OIDs in the <MIBNAME> MIB along with their labels. Redirect to a file for nicer formatting as needed. Example: $ snmptranslate -m IF-MIB -Tz -On > out.log $ cat out.log \"org\" \"1.3\" \"dod\" \"1.3.6\" \"internet\" \"1.3.6.1\" \"directory\" \"1.3.6.1.1\" \"mgmt\" \"1.3.6.1.2\" \"mib-2\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1\" \"system\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1\" \"sysDescr\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1\" \"sysObjectID\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2\" \"sysUpTime\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3\" \"sysContact\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4\" \"sysName\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5\" \"sysLocation\" \"1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6\" [...] Tip Use the -M <DIR> option to specify the directory where snmptranslate should look for MIBs. Useful if you want to inspect a MIB you've just downloaded but not moved to the default MIB directory.

If you're already familiar with the SNMP protocol, feel free to skip to the next page. What is SNMP? \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol for monitoring network devices . It uses UDP and supports both a request/response model (commands and queries) and a notification model (traps, informs). In the request/response model, the SNMP manager (eg. the Datadog Agent) issues an SNMP command ( GET , GETNEXT , BULK ) to an SNMP agent (eg. a network device). SNMP was born in the 1980s, so it has been around for a long time. While more modern alternatives like NETCONF and OpenConfig have been gaining attention, a large amount of network devices still use SNMP as their primary monitoring interface. SNMP versions \u00b6 The SNMP protocol exists in 3 versions: v1 (legacy), v2c , and v3 . The main differences between v1/v2c and v3 are the authentication mechanism and transport layer, as summarized below. Version Authentication Transport layer v1/v2c Password (the community string ) Plain text only v3 Username/password Support for packet signing and encryption OIDs \u00b6 What is an OID? \u00b6 Identifiers for queryable quantities An OID , also known as an Object Identifier , is an identifier for a quantity (\"object\") that can be retrieved from an SNMP device. Such quantities may include uptime, temperature, network traffic, etc (quantities available will vary across devices). To make them processable by machines, OIDs are represented as dot-separated sequences of numbers, e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 . Global definition OIDs are globally defined , which means they have the same meaning regardless of the device that processes the SNMP query. For example, querying the 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 OID (also known as sysDescr ) on any SNMP agent will make it return the system description. (More on the OID/label mapping can be found in the MIBs section below.) Not all OIDs contain metrics data OIDs can refer to various types of objects, such as strings, numbers, tables, etc. In particular, this means that only a fraction of OIDs refer to numerical quantities that can actually be sent as metrics to Datadog. However, non-numerical OIDs can also be useful, especially for tagging. The OID tree \u00b6 OIDs are structured in a tree-like fashion. Each number in the OID represents a node in the tree. The wildcard notation is often used to refer to a sub-tree of OIDs, e.g. 1.3.6.1.2.* . It so happens that there are two main OID sub-trees: a sub-tree for general-purpose OIDs, and a sub-tree for vendor-specific OIDs. Generic OIDs \u00b6 Located under the sub-tree: 1.3.6.1.2.1.* (a.k.a. SNMPv2-MIB or mib-2 ). These OIDs are applicable to all kinds of network devices (although all devices may not expose all OIDs in this sub-tree). For example, 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 corresponds to sysDescr , which contains a free-form, human-readable description of the device. Vendor-specific OIDs \u00b6 Located under the sub-tree: 1.3.6.1.4.1.* (a.k.a. enterprises ). These OIDs are defined and managed by network device vendors themselves. Each vendor is assigned its own enterprise sub-tree in the form of 1.3.6.1.4.1.<N>.* . For example: 1.3.6.1.4.1.2.* is the sub-tree for IBM-specific OIDs. 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.* is the sub-tree for Cisco-specific OIDs. The full list of vendor sub-trees can be found here: SNMP OID 1.3.6.1.4.1 . Notable OIDs \u00b6 OID Label Description 1.3.6.1.2.1.2 sysObjectId An OID whose value is an OID that represents the device make and model (yes, it's a bit meta). 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1 sysDescr A human-readable, free-form description of the device. 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3 sysUpTimeInstance The device uptime. MIBs \u00b6 What is an MIB? \u00b6 OIDs are grouped in modules called MIBs (Management Information Base). An MIB describes the hierarchy of a given set of OIDs. (This is somewhat analogous to a dictionary that contains the definitions for each word in a spoken language.) For example, the IF-MIB describes the hierarchy of OIDs within the sub-tree 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.* . These OIDs contain metrics about the network interfaces available on the device. (Note how its location under the 1.3.6.1.2.* sub-tree indicates that it is a generic MIB, available on most network devices.) As part of the description of OIDs, an MIB defines a human-readable label for each OID. For example, IF-MIB describes the OID 1.3.6.1.2.1.1 and assigns it the label sysDescr . The operation that consists in finding the OID from a label is called OID resolution . Tools and resources \u00b6 The following resources can be useful when working with MIBs: MIB Discovery : a search engine for OIDs. Use it to find what an OID corresponds to, which MIB it comes from, what label it is known as, etc. Circitor MIB files repository : a repository and search engine where one can download actual .mib files. SNMP Labs MIB repository : alternate repo of many common MIBs. Note : this site hosts the underlying MIBs which the pysnmp-mibs library (used by the SNMP Python check) actually validates against. Double check any MIB you get from an alternate source with what is in this repo.

(More on the OID/label mapping can be found in the MIBs section below.) Not all OIDs contain metrics data OIDs can refer to various types of objects, such as strings, numbers, tables, etc. In particular, this means that only a fraction of OIDs refer to numerical quantities that can actually be sent as metrics to Datadog. However, non-numerical OIDs can also be useful, especially for tagging.","title":"What is an OID?"},{"location":"tutorials/snmp/introduction/#the-oid-tree","text":"OIDs are structured in a tree-like fashion.

An SNMP profile is materialised as a YAML file with the following structure: sysobjectid : <x.y.z...> # extends: # <Optional list of base profiles to extend from...> metrics : # <List of metrics to collect...> # metric_tags: # <List of tags to apply to collected metrics. Required for table metrics, optional otherwise> Fields \u00b6 sysobjectid \u00b6 (Required) The sysobjectid field is used to match profiles against devices during device autodiscovery. It can refer to a fully-defined OID for a specific device make and model: sysobjectid : 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.9.4.10 or a wildcard pattern to address multiple device models: sysobjectid : 1.3.6.1.131.12.4.* or a list of fully-defined OID / wildcard patterns: sysobjectid : - 1.3.6.1.131.12.4.* - 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.9.4.10 extends \u00b6 (Optional) This field can be used to include metrics and metric tags from other so-called base profiles . Base profiles can derive from other base profiles to build a hierarchy of reusable profile mixins. Important All device profiles should extend from the _base.yaml profile, which defines items that should be collected for all devices. Example: extends : - _base.yaml - _generic-if.yaml # Include basic metrics from IF-MIB. metrics \u00b6 (Required) Entries in the metrics field define which metrics will be collected by the profile. They can reference either a single OID (a.k.a symbol ), or an SNMP table. Symbol metrics \u00b6 An SNMP symbol is an object with a scalar type (i.e. Counter32 , Integer32 , OctetString , etc). In a MIB file, a symbol can be recognized as an OBJECT-TYPE node with a scalar SYNTAX , placed under an OBJECT IDENTIFIER node (which is often the root OID of the MIB): EXAMPLE-MIB DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN -- ... example OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { mib-2 7 } exampleSymbol OBJECT-TYPE SYNTAX Counter32 -- ... ::= { example 1 } In profiles, symbol metrics can be specified as entries that specify the MIB and symbol fields: metrics : # Example for the above dummy MIB and symbol: - MIB : EXAMPLE-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.5.1.2.1.7.1 name : exampleSymbol # More realistic examples: - MIB : ISILON-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.12124.1.1.2 name : clusterHealth - MIB : ISILON-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.12124.1.2.1.1 name : clusterIfsInBytes - MIB : ISILON-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.12124.1.2.1.3 name : clusterIfsOutBytes Warning Symbol metrics from the same MIB must still be listed as separate metrics entries, as shown above. For example, this is not valid syntax: metrics : - MIB : ISILON-MIB symbol : - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.12124.1.2.1.1 name : clusterIfsInBytes - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.12124.1.2.1.3 name : clusterIfsOutBytes Table metrics \u00b6 An SNMP table is an object that is composed of multiple entries (\"rows\"), where each entry contains values a set of symbols (\"columns\"). In a MIB file, tables be recognized by the presence of SEQUENCE OF : exampleTable OBJECT-TYPE SYNTAX SEQUENCE OF exampleEntry -- ... ::= { example 10 } exampleEntry OBJECT-TYPE -- ... ::= { exampleTable 1 } exampleColumn1 OBJECT-TYPE -- ... ::= { exampleEntry 1 } exampleColumn2 OBJECT-TYPE -- ... ::= { exampleEntry 2 } -- ... In profiles, tables can be specified as entries containing the MIB , table and symbols fields: metrics : # Example for the dummy table above: - MIB : EXAMPLE-MIB table : # Identification of the table which metrics come from. OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.10 name : exampleTable symbols : # List of symbols ('columns') to retrieve. # Same format as for a single OID. # Each row in the table will emit these metrics. - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.10.1.1 name : exampleColumn1 - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.10.1.2 name : exampleColumn2 # ... # More realistic example: - MIB : CISCO-PROCESS-MIB table : # Each row in this table contains information about a CPU unit of the device.

Table metrics tagging \u00b6 Table metrics require metric_tags to identify each row's metric. It is possible to add tags to metrics retrieved from a table in three ways: Using a column within the same table \u00b6 metrics : - MIB : IF-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2 name : ifTable symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.14 name : ifInErrors # ... metric_tags : # Add an 'interface' tag to each metric of each row, # whose value is obtained from the 'ifDescr' column of the row. # This allows querying metrics by interface, e.g. 'interface:eth0'. - tag : interface column : OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2 name : ifDescr Using a column from a different table with identical indexes \u00b6 metrics : - MIB : CISCO-IF-EXTENSION-MIB forced_type : monotonic_count table : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.276.1.1.2 name : cieIfInterfaceTable symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.276.1.1.2.1.1 name : cieIfResetCount metric_tags : - MIB : IF-MIB column : OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.1 name : ifName table : ifXTable tag : interface Using a column from a different table with different indexes \u00b6 metrics : - MIB : CPI-UNITY-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.30932.1.10.1.3.110 name : cpiPduBranchTable symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.30932.1.10.1.3.110.1.3 name : cpiPduBranchCurrent metric_tags : - column : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.30932.1.10.1.2.10.1.3 name : cpiPduName table : cpiPduTable index_transform : - start : 1 end : 7 tag : pdu_name If the external table has different indexes, use index_transform to select a subset of the full index. index_transform is a list of start / end ranges to extract from the current table index to match the external table index. start and end are inclusive. External table indexes must be a subset of the indexes of the current table, or same indexes in a different order. Example In the example above, the index of cpiPduBranchTable looks like 1.6.0.36.155.53.3.246 , the first digit is the cpiPduBranchId index and the rest is the cpiPduBranchMac index. The index of cpiPduTable looks like 6.0.36.155.53.3.246 and represents cpiPduMac (equivalent to cpiPduBranchMac ). By using the index_transform with start 1 and end 7, we extract 6.0.36.155.53.3.246 from 1.6.0.36.155.53.3.246 ( cpiPduBranchTable full index), and then use it to match 6.0.36.155.53.3.246 ( cpiPduTable full index). index_transform can be more complex, the following definition will extract 2.3.5.6.7 from 1.2.3.4.5.6.7 . index_transform : - start : 1 end : 2 - start : 4 end : 6 Using an index \u00b6 Important: \" index \" refers to one digit of the index part of the row OID. Example, if the column OID is 1.2.3.1.2 and the row OID is 1.2.3.1.2.7.8.9 , the full index is 7.8.9 . In this example, when using index: 1 , we will refer to 7 , index: 2 will refer to 8 , and so on. metrics : - MIB : CISCO-PROCESS-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1 name : cpmCPUTotalTable symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109.1.1.1.1.12 name : cpmCPUMemoryUsed metric_tags : # This tagging method is more complex, so let's walk through an example... # # In CISCO-PROCESS-MIB, we can see that entries in the `cpmCPUTotalTable` are indexed by `cpmCPUTotalIndex`, # which corresponds to some sort of CPU position for each row in the table: # # cpmCPUTotalEntry OBJECT-TYPE # -- ... # INDEX { cpmCPUTotalIndex } # <-- See? # # We want to tag metrics in this table by this CPU position. # # To do this, we look up the position of this OID in `INDEX`. Here we see it's in 1st position. # So we can reference it here using `index: 1`. # (If there were two OIDs in `INDEX`, and we wanted to use the one in 2nd position, then we would have used `index: 2`.) # # NOTE: currently only indexes that refer to a column in the same table are supported. - tag : cpu index : 1 Mapping index to tag string value \u00b6 You can use the following syntax to map indexes to tag string values. In the example below, the submitted metrics will be snmp.ipSystemStatsHCInReceives with tags like ipversion:ipv6 . metrics : - MIB : IP-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1 name : ipSystemStatsTable forced_type : monotonic_count symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.4 name : ipSystemStatsHCInReceives metric_tags : - index : 1 tag : ipversion mapping : 0 : unknown 1 : ipv4 2 : ipv6 3 : ipv4z 4 : ipv6z 16 : dns See meaning of index as used here in Using an index section. Tagging tips \u00b6 Note General guidelines on Datadog tagging also apply to table metric tags. In particular, be mindful of the kind of value contained in the columns used a tag sources. E.g. avoid using a DisplayString (an arbitrarily long human-readable text description) or unbounded sources (timestamps, IDs...) as tag values. Good candidates for tag values include short strings, enums, or integer indexes. Metric type inference \u00b6 By default, the Datadog metric type of a symbol will be inferred from the SNMP type (i.e. the MIB SYNTAX ): SNMP type Inferred metric type Counter32 rate Counter64 rate Gauge32 gauge Integer gauge Integer32 gauge CounterBasedGauge64 gauge Opaque gauge SNMP types not listed in this table are submitted as gauge by default. Forced metric types \u00b6 Sometimes the inferred type may not be what you want. Typically, OIDs that represent \"total number of X\" are defined as Counter32 in MIBs, but you probably want to submit them monotonic_count instead of a rate . For such cases, you can define a forced_type . Possible values and their effect are listed below. Forced type Description gauge Submit as a gauge. rate Submit as a rate. percent Multiply by 100 and submit as a rate. monotonic_count Submit as a monotonic count. monotonic_count_and_rate Submit 2 copies of the metric: one as a monotonic count, and one as a rate (suffixed with .rate ). flag_stream Submit each flag of a flag stream as individual metric with value 0 or 1 . See Flag Stream section . This works on both symbol and table metrics: metrics : # On a symbol: - MIB : TCP-MIB forced_type : monotonic_count symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.5 name : tcpActiveOpens # On a table: - MIB : IP-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1 name : ipSystemStatsTable forced_type : monotonic_count symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.4 name : ipSystemStatsHCInReceives - OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.4.31.1.1.6 name : ipSystemStatsHCInOctets Note When used on a table metrics entry, forced_type is applied to all symbols in the entry. So, if a table contains symbols of varying types, you should use multiple metrics entries: one for symbols with inferred metric types, and one for each forced_type . For example: metrics : - MIB : F5-BIGIP-LOCAL-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.2.5.2.3 name : ltmPoolStatTable # No `forced_type` specified => metric types will be inferred. symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.2.5.2.3.1.2 name : ltmPoolStatServerPktsIn - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.2.5.2.3.1.4 name : ltmPoolStatServerPktsOut # ... - MIB : F5-BIGIP-LOCAL-MIB table : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.2.5.2.3 name : ltmPoolStatTable forced_type : monotonic_count # All these symbols will be submitted as monotonic counts. symbols : - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.2.5.2.3.1.7 name : ltmPoolStatServerTotConns - OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.2.5.2.3.1.23 name : ltmPoolStatConnqServiced # ... Flag stream \u00b6 When the value is a flag stream like 010101 , you can use forced_type: flag_stream to submit each flag as individual metric with value 0 or 1 . Two options are required when using flag_stream : options.placement : position of the flag in the flag stream (1-based indexing, first element is placement 1). options.metric_suffix : suffix appended to the metric name for a specific flag, usually matching the name of the flag. Example: metrics : - MIB : PowerNet-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.11.1.1.0 name : upsBasicStateOutputState forced_type : flag_stream options : placement : 4 metric_suffix : OnLine - MIB : PowerNet-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.318.1.1.1.11.1.1.0 name : upsBasicStateOutputState forced_type : flag_stream options : placement : 5 metric_suffix : ReplaceBattery This example will submit two metrics snmp.upsBasicStateOutputState.OnLine and snmp.upsBasicStateOutputState.ReplaceBattery with value 0 or 1 . Example of flag_stream usage in a profile . Extract value \u00b6 If the metric value to be submitted is from a OID with string value and needs to be extracted from it, you can use extract value feature. extract_value is a regex pattern with one capture group like (\\d+)C , where the capture group is (\\d+) . Example use cases respective regex patterns: stripping the C unit from a temperature value: (\\d+)C stripping the USD unit from a currency value: USD(\\d+) stripping the F unit from a temperature value with spaces between the metric and the unit: (\\d+) *F Example: Scalar Metric Example: metrics : - MIB : MY-MIB symbol : OID : 1.2.3.4.5.6.7 name : temperature extract_value : '(\\d+)C' Table Column Metric Example: metrics : - MIB : MY-MIB table : OID : 1.2.3.4.5.6 name : myTable symbols : - OID : 1.2.3.4.5.6.7 name : temperature extract_value : '(\\d+)C' # ... In the examples above, the OID value is a snmp OctetString value 22C and we want 22 to be submitted as value for snmp.temperature . metric_tags \u00b6 (Optional) This field is used to apply tags to all metrics collected by the profile. It has the same meaning than the instance-level config option (see conf.yaml.example ). Several collection methods are supported, as illustrated below: metric_tags : - OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 symbol : sysName tag : snmp_host - # With regular expression matching OID : 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 symbol : sysName match : (.*)-(.*) tags : device_type : \\1 host : \\2","title":"Profile Format Reference"},{"location":"tutorials/snmp/profile-format/#profile-format-reference","text":"","title":"Profile Format Reference"},{"location":"tutorials/snmp/profile-format/#overview","text":"SNMP profiles are our way of providing out-of-the-box monitoring for certain makes and models of network devices.

By using the index_transform with start 1 and end 7, we extract 6.0.36.155.53.3.246 from 1.6.0.36.155.53.3.246 ( cpiPduBranchTable full index), and then use it to match 6.0.36.155.53.3.246 ( cpiPduTable full index). index_transform can be more complex, the following definition will extract 2.3.5.6.7 from 1.2.3.4.5.6.7 . index_transform : - start : 1 end : 2 - start : 4 end : 6","title":"Using a column from a different table with different indexes"},{"location":"tutorials/snmp/profile-format/#using-an-index","text":"Important: \" index \" refers to one digit of the index part of the row OID.

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of building a basic SNMP profile that collects OID metrics from HP iLO4 devices. Feel free to read the Introduction to SNMP if you need a refresher on SNMP concepts such as OIDs and MIBs. Ready? Let's get started! Research \u00b6 The first step to building an SNMP profile is doing some basic research about the device, and which metrics we want to collect. General device information \u00b6 Generally, you'll want to search the web and find out about the following: Device name, manufacturer, and device sysobjectid . Understand what the device does, and what it is used for. (Which metrics are relevant varies between routers, switches, bridges, etc. See Networking hardware .) E.g. from the HP iLO Wikipedia page , we can see that iLO4 devices are used by system administrators for remote management of embedded servers. Available versions of the device, and which ones we target. E.g. HP iLO devices exist in multiple versions (version 3, version 4...). Here, we are specifically targeting HP iLO4. Supported MIBs and OIDs (often available in official documentation), and associated MIB files. E.g. we can see that HP provides a MIB package for iLO devices here . Metrics selection \u00b6 Now that we have gathered some basic information about the device and its SNMP interfaces, we should decide which metrics we want to collect. (Devices often expose thousands of metrics through SNMP. We certainly don't want to collect them all.) Devices typically expose thousands of OIDs that can span dozens of MIB, so this can feel daunting at first. Remember, never give up! Some guidelines to help you in this process: 10-40 metrics is a good amount already. Explore base profiles to see which ones could be applicable to the device. Explore manufacturer-specific MIB files looking for metrics such as: General health: status gauges... Network traffic: bytes in/out, errors in/out, ... CPU and memory usage. Temperature: temperature sensors, thermal condition, ... Power supply. Storage. Field-replaceable units ( FRU ). ... Implementation \u00b6 It might be tempting to gather as many metrics as possible, and only then start building the profile and writing tests. But we recommend you start small . This will allow you to quickly gain confidence on the various components of the SNMP development workflow: Editing profile files. Writing tests. Building and using simulation data. Add a profile file \u00b6 Add a .yaml file for the profile with the sysobjectid and a metric (you'll be able to add more later). For example: sysobjectid : 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.9.4.10 metrics : - MIB : CPQHLTH-MIB symbol : OID : 1.3.6.1.4.1.232.6.2.8.1.0 name : cpqHeSysUtilLifeTime Tip sysobjectid can also be a wildcard pattern to match a sub-tree of devices, eg 1.3.6.1.131.12.4.* . Generate a profile file from a collection of MIBs \u00b6 You can use ddev to create a profile from a list of mibs. $ ddev meta snmp generate-profile-from-mibs --help This script requires a list of ASN1 MIB files as input argument, and copies to the clipboard a list of metrics that can be used to create a profile. Options \u00b6 -f, --filters is an option to provide the path to a YAML file containing a collection of MIB names and their list of node names to be included. For example: RFC1213-MIB : - system - interfaces - ip CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB : [] SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB : - snmpEngine Will include system , interfaces and ip nodes from RFC1213-MIB , no node from CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB , and node snmpEngine from SNMP-FRAMEWORK-MIB . Note that each MIB:node_name correspond to exactly one and only one OID. However, some MIBs report legacy nodes that are overwritten. To resolve, edit the MIB by removing legacy values manually before loading them with this profile generator. If a MIB is fully supported, it can be omitted from the filter as MIBs not found in a filter will be fully loaded. If a MIB is not fully supported, it can be listed with an empty node list, as CISCO-SYSLOG-MIB in the example. -a, --aliases is an option to provide the path to a YAML file containing a list of aliases to be used as metric tags for tables, in the following format: aliases : - from : MIB : ENTITY-MIB name : entPhysicalIndex to : MIB : ENTITY-MIB name : entPhysicalName MIBs tables most of the time define one or more indexes, as columns within the same table, or columns from a different table and even a different MIB. The index value can be used to tag table's metrics. This is defined in the INDEX field in row nodes. As an example, entPhysicalContainsTable in ENTITY-MIB is as follows: entPhysicalContainsEntry OBJECT-TYPE SYNTAX EntPhysicalContainsEntry MAX-ACCESS not-accessible STATUS current DESCRIPTION \"A single container/'containee' relationship.\" INDEX { entPhysicalIndex, entPhysicalChildIndex } <== this is the index definition ::= { entPhysicalContainsTable 1 } or its JSON dump, where INDEX is replaced by indices : \"entPhysicalContainsEntry\" : { \"name\" : \"entPhysicalContainsEntry\" , \"oid\" : \"1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.3.3.1\" , \"nodetype\" : \"row\" , \"class\" : \"objecttype\" , \"maxaccess\" : \"not-accessible\" , \"indices\" : [ { \"module\" : \"ENTITY-MIB\" , \"object\" : \"entPhysicalIndex\" , \"implied\" : 0 }, { \"module\" : \"ENTITY-MIB\" , \"object\" : \"entPhysicalChildIndex\" , \"implied\" : 0 } ], \"status\" : \"current\" , \"description\" : \"A single container/'containee' relationship.\" }, Indexes can be replaced by another MIB symbol that is more human friendly. You might prefer to see the interface name versus its numerical table index. This can be achieved using metric_tag_aliases . Add unit tests \u00b6 Add a unit test in test_profiles.py to verify that the metric is successfully collected by the integration when the profile is enabled. (These unit tests are mostly used to prevent regressions and will help with maintenance.) For example: def test_hp_ilo4 ( aggregator ): run_profile_check ( 'hp_ilo4' ) common_tags = common . CHECK_TAGS + [ 'snmp_profile:hp-ilo4' ] aggregator . assert_metric ( 'snmp.cpqHeSysUtilLifeTime' , metric_type = aggregator . MONOTONIC_COUNT , tags = common_tags , count = 1 ) aggregator . assert_all_metrics_covered () We don't have simulation data yet, so the test should fail.
